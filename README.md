# <Module01-Challenge>

## Description

The motivation was to take the client's existing website and refactor it in order to optimize search results and provide additional accessibility. It increases the ability for those with disabilities to be abled to find, utilize, and enjoy the content of the site. I learned how to properly arrange and re-format existing code to semantic HTML structure in addition to proper grouping and classification of CSS identifiers.
